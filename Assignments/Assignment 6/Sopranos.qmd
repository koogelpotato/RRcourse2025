# The Sopranos

## Main

**The Sopranos** is an [American crime drama television series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos) created by David Chase. The series aired on HBO from January 10, 1999, to June 10, 2007, and consists of six seasons totaling 86 episodes.

## Views
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Data
data = {
    "Season": ["Season 2", "Season 3", "Season 4", "Season 5", "Season 6"],
    "Average Views (millions)": [6.51, 8.75, 10.95, 9.8, 8.25]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x="Season", y="Average Views (millions)", data=df, palette="magma")

# Highlight season 4
bar = plt.gca().patches[2]
bar.set_edgecolor('black')
bar.set_linewidth(2)

plt.title("Average Viewership per Season (excluding Season 1)")
plt.ylabel("Average Viewers (millions)")
plt.xlabel("Season")
plt.grid(axis="y", linestyle="--", alpha=0.5)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

## Table representation
| Season   | Average views               |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| Season 2 | 6.51 million (lowest avg)   |
| Season 3 | 8.75 million                |
| Season 4 | 10.95 million (highest avg) |
| Season 5 | 9.8 million                 |
| Season 6 | 8.25 million                |

## Why Season 4 Stood Out

I think Season Four was the culmination of everything Chase wanted to do with the show. It was the perfect balance of family life and mafia life while feeling a lot more mature than the first 3 seasons. I think they really hit the "style" they wanted.
